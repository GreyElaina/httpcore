        A connection pool for making HTTP requests.

        Parameters:
            ssl_context: An SSL context to use for verifying connections.
                If not specified, the default `httpcore.default_ssl_context()`
                will be used.
            max_connections: The maximum number of concurrent HTTP connections that
                the pool should allow. Any attempt to send a request on a pool that
                would exceed this amount will block until a connection is available.
            max_keepalive_connections: The maximum number of idle HTTP connections
                that will be maintained in the pool.
            keepalive_expiry: The duration in seconds that an idle HTTP connection
                may be maintained for before being expired from the pool.
            http1: A boolean indicating if HTTP/1.1 requests should be supported
                by the connection pool. Defaults to True.
            http2: A boolean indicating if HTTP/2 requests should be supported by
                the connection pool. Defaults to False.
            retries: The maximum number of retries when trying to establish a
                connection.
            local_address: Local address to connect from. Can also be used to connect
                using a particular address family. Using `local_address="0.0.0.0"`
                will connect using an `AF_INET` address (IPv4), while using
                `local_address="::"` will connect using an `AF_INET6` address (IPv6).
            uds: Path to a Unix Domain Socket to use instead of TCP sockets.
            network_backend: A backend instance to use for handling network I/O.
            socket_options: Socket options that have to be included
             in the TCP socket when the connection was established.
